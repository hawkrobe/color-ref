* Experiment 1 can be run by navigating to `experiments/experiment1`, running `npm install` to install dependencies, then running `node app.js` to launch the experiment. 

* Experiment 2 can be run by doing the same thing in `experiments/experiment2`.

After launching the experiment, go to `http://localhost:8887/experiment.html`
